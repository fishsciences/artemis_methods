## Abstract

This manuscript will introduce the custom model written to analyze the
results from a series of live car eDNA experiments conducted with
Delta Smelt in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.  We explain why a
custom model was needed and how it is well-suited to handle the
sources of measurement error common to eDNA survey data, as well as
the truncated data structure of data generated by the process of qPCR
analysis.  We will discuss and compare the performance of our model to
the standard two-level occupancy model and to commonly used binomial
regression approaches for estimating effects on concentration of eDNA
and the probability of detection.  We will then discuss when and how
our model performs better in most cases, and also address the
situations in which other models may be the better choice.  Finally,
we will introduce the artemis R package, which assists in flexible
application of the model and includes multiple additional analysis
tools for eDNA studies.
