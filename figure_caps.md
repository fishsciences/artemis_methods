Fig. 1: Plot of experimental livecar data from two experiments at the Tracy
Fish Collection Facility (TFCF) in the Central Valley Project (CVP),
California, USA. These data were used to test different analysis
techniques for environmental DNA (eDNA) survey data. Each point
represents one technical replicate. The Cq of each technical replicate
has been converted to ln[eDNA] via the standard curve, where $ln[eDNA]
= (Cq - \alpha_{StdCurve}) / \beta_{StdCurve}$.

Fig. 2: Comparison of lmer vs eDNA_lmer to recover parameters from
500 simulated datasets. Blue areas are the 95\% Credible Intervals,
while black areas are the median parameter estimates. The "true value"
used in the simulation is marked as a dashed
line.
