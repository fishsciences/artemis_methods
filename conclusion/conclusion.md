# Conclusion

To solve many of the issues facing analyzing qPCR eDNA data using
standard statistical methods, we created the `artemis` R package. The
`artemis` package combines drop-in replacements for linear modeling
functions in R.These models show less bias and more predictive
accuracy for censored eDNA data, compared to standard linear models.
Additionally, `artemis` includes many functions to support a full eDNA
workflow.
