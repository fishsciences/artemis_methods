# Introduction

<!-- Background info about eDNA studies generally -->

Environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys provide an indirect yet noninvasive
[@sigsgaard_monitoring_2015], unharmful, sensitive
[@fernandez_nonindigenous_2019; @pilliod_estimating_2013], inexpensive
[@akre_concurrent_2019], and rapid way to detect rare, cryptic, or
invasive organisms in water
[@fukumoto_basin-scale_2015; @goldberg_environmental_2013]. Given these
strengths, sampling for and detecting eDNA using quantitative
Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) has gained popularity over the past
20 years [@dejean_improved_2012; @moyer_assessing_2014] and is now broadly
used to sample and indirectly infer presence of taxa in a variety of
aquatic, marine, and estuary environments. However, widespread
sampling and detection of eDNA by ecologists and conservation
biologists is unstandardized, and the field is in need of standards
for analysis and reporting [@fediajevaite_metaanalysis_2021]. In this paper,
we introduce a custom latent-variable model designed for the analysis
of quantitative PCR data from eDNA studies. We present its advantages
over the models that are more frequently employed for analyzing qPCR
data, and discuss its potential for assisting in the movement toward
standardization of analysis methods employed in eDNA studies that use
qPCR.
