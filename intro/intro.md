# Introduction

Environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys provide an indirect yet noninvasive
[@sigsgaard_monitoring_2015], unharmful, sensitive
[@fernandez_nonindigenous_2019; @pilliod_estimating_2013], inexpensive
[@akre_concurrent_2019], and rapid way to detect rare, cryptic, or
invasive organisms in water [@fukumoto_basin-scale_2015;
@goldberg_environmental_2013]. Given these strengths, sampling for and
detecting eDNA using quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) has
gained popularity over the past 20 years [@dejean_improved_2012;
@moyer_assessing_2014] and is now broadly used to sample and
indirectly infer presence of taxa in a variety of aquatic environments. However, widespread sampling and detection of
eDNA by ecologists and conservation biologists is unstandardized, and
the field is in need of standards for analysis and reporting
[@fediajevaite_metaanalysis_2021]. 
In addition, managers need assistance to understand the biological
significance of a set of eDNA observations. This paper describes how
probability statements about species presence can be developed using
the `artemis` package and an eDNA sampling scheme.
