                  aquatic species are advancing rapidly, but with
                  little evaluation of field protocols or precision of
                  resulting estimates. We compared sampling results
                  from traditional field methods with eDNA methods for
                  two amphibians in 13 streams in central Idaho,
                  USA. We also evaluated three water collection
                  protocols and the influence of sampling location,
                  time of day, and distance from animals on eDNA
                  concentration in the water. We found no difference
                  in detection or amount of eDNA among water
                  collection protocols. eDNA methods had slightly
                  higher detection rates than traditional field
                  methods, particularly when species occurred at low
                  densities. eDNA concentration was positively related
                  to field-measured density, biomass, and proportion
                  of transects occupied. Precision of eDNA-based
                  abundance estimates increased with the amount of
                  eDNA in the water and the number of replicate
                  subsamples collected. eDNA concentration did not
                  vary significantly with sample location in the
                  stream, time of day, or distance downstream from
                  animals. Our results further advance the
                  implementation of eDNA methods for monitoring
