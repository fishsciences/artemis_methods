# artemis package manuscript

This is the development repo for the [accompanying manuscript](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/edn3.277) and is for archival purposes only.  It is the version prior to final edits with the publisher.  This repository is to reproduce the analysis - it does not re-create the final published manuscript.

To make, use 

```
make all
```

at the commandline. You will need working installations of pandoc and LaTeX, as well as the [scholarly-metadata.lua filter](https://github.com/pandoc/lua-filters).

## Where to edit

If you would like to edit the meta-data or formatting, please edit
[format.yaml](format.yaml).

If you would like to add references, put them in [bibtex
format](http://www.bibtex.org/Format/) in [artemis.bib](artemis.bib).
