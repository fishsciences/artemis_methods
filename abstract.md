## Abstract {-}

We introduce `artemis`, a new package for the R stastical programming
environment designed to analyze qPCR data from environmental DNA
studies. The `artemis` package directly addresses several challenges
for analyzing eDNA survey data, including the censorship of recorded
data generated by the process of qPCR analysis and sources of
measurement error common.  The performance of `artemis` models is
compared to commonly used regression approaches using both simulated
and experimental data. We demonstrate `artemis` models have several
favorable charactoristics compared to standard regression approaches,
while offering similar ease of use. Lastly, we discuss possible
trade-offs and considerations for choosing the most appropriate
analysis platform for eDNA survey data.
