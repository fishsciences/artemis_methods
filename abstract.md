## Abstract {-}

We introduce `artemis`, a new package for the R statistical programming
environment designed to analyze quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction
(qPCR) data from environmental DNA
studies. The `artemis` package directly addresses several challenges
for analyzing eDNA survey data, including the censorship of
data generated by qPCR analysis.  The performance of `artemis` models is
compared to commonly-used regression approaches using both simulated
and experimental data. We demonstrate that the models in `artemis` have several
favorable characteristics compared to standard regression approaches,
yielding more accurate estimates, less bias, and better prediction
performance while offering similar ease of use. Lastly, we discuss
possible trade-offs and considerations for choosing the most
appropriate analysis approach for eDNA survey data.
