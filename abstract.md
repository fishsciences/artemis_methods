## Abstract {-}

We introduce `artemis`, a new package for the R statistical programming
environment designed to analyze qPCR data from environmental DNA
studies. The `artemis` package directly addresses several challenges
for analyzing eDNA survey data, including the censorship of recorded
data generated by the process of qPCR analysis and sources of
measurement error.  The performance of `artemis` models is
compared to commonly-used regression approaches using both simulated
and experimental data. We demonstrate that the models in `artemis` have several
favorable characteristics compared to standard regression approaches,
yielding more accurate estimates, less bias, and better prediction
performance while offering similar ease of use. Lastly, we discuss
possible trade-offs and considerations for choosing the most
appropriate analysis approach for eDNA survey data.
