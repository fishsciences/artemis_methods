# Results

Model diagnostics and inferences from each model 

## Simulated data

biases in point estimates
accuracy of CIs?


## Experimental data

WAIC/LOO
out of sample predictions?

![Comparison of lmer vs eDNA_lmer to recover parameters from 500 simulated
datasets. Blue areas are the 95\% Credible Intervals, while black areas
are the median parameter estimates. The "true value" used in the
simulation is marked as a dashed line.](analysis/figs/coef_est_compare.png)
